## Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Process
* Started the project in early April (_08/04/2021_) 
* Decided to make the page using tabs instead of a fixed sidebar (_11/04/2021_)

 ### Welcome
*  Since joining the FAC Discord channel, I've been seeing a lot of wave emojis, so I wanted to add a wave animation to my project üëãüèæ (_11/04/2021_)
*  Also wanted to add an audio file to my project as I hadn't used one prior to this (_12/04/2021_).

### About Me
* Completed the content of the About Me section (_11/04/2021_)
* Made the page picture tiles (flip cards) (_17/04_2021_)
* Finished the About Me Page (_02/05/2021_)

### Why FAC?
* Started on the Why FAC page, decided to make the layout mini tiles for greater visibility (_24/04/2021_)
* Finalised Why FAC page (_08/05/2021_)

### Projects
*  Started on the projects page, decided to make the page collapsible buttons (_10/05/2021_).
*  Decided to create a final surprise button, to add a few mystery projects (_18/05/2021_).
* Had an issue with the collapsible buttons as the first one didn‚Äôt work, with __Dragonfly__ I learnt how to use Dev Tools to see where the problem was. My use of ___nextElementSibling___ was the issue. (_20/05/2021_)
*  Solved that previous issue by making a new hidden button. (_21/05/2021_)

### Thank You!
* Changed the final page from Coaching to Thank You! I didn't want a content heavy final page to the project and thanking everyone was the perfect way to finish (_16/05/2021_)
* Finalised the Thank You! page (_21/05/2021_)

### Issues
* Had a few issues debugging for ___media queries on mobile screens___ (800px and under). In the final coaching session, I went over the problem with __Orian__ and __Ruth__ and discovered that my use of ___margins___ was the root of the problem. Altering them solved the issue. (_25/05/2021_)
* The final issue was when I tried playing my ___welcome message on Safari___. I added an OGG and WAV version to solve this (_26/05/2021_).

## Features
* - [x] __5 seperate tabs!__
* - [x] __Flip card about me section!__
* - [x] __Projects page with 7 unique projects!__
* - [x] __3 dynamic collapsible button styles!__
* - [x] __Adjustable pages!__

## Inspiration
* Design inspired by websites I use everyday (e.g. __Google__, __Facebook__, etc.). The simplicity in design is what I was going for.
* A recent FAC grad (_sorry can't remember your name_) said their page was made up of mini projects, and that was an idea I really liked.
