                  <p>The Founders and Coders course has an extensive pre-apprenticeship program, which would give candiates the perfect balance of technical and soft-skills for employment. With this aim in mind, I see myself improving greatly in both areas through this and is an important reason why I'm applying.</p>

                  <p>Unlike similar bootcamps, Founders and Coders offer an apprenticeship scheme, in which students can gain real-world experience and get there foot in the door in the industry. This, coupled with the skills learnt in the 12-week pre-apprenticehip program, gives me confidence that I will, not only be job ready after the course, but I will be in good hands at the start of my career.</p>
